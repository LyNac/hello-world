# hello-world

I am Lynda and I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm quite good at repeating what I've read and/or been told to do.

My first website went live in 1997 and I'm still trying to keep up with the needs of a growing Internet. On Mondays I make a comic called Tails From The Backyard and in my spare time I sit under a tree and narrowly avoid being eaten.

I was previously making it my life's work to raise awareness of Chiari Malformation, but people's eyes glaze over once I explain why I'm lying on the block of ice.
